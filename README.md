# Dufour_et_al_2022
Quick workflows to generate figures from the figures 4, 8 and S8 of the paper Dufour et al, Loss of SUMO-specific protease 2 causes isolated glucocorticoid deficiency by blocking adrenal cortex zonal transdifferentiation in mice

The first one aims to show how I analysed z-stack pictures taken from PLA stainings of adrenal. 
The second one's purpose is to share the workflow I used to correlate differentially expressed genes between males and female in my RNA-sequencing data on Sf1-Senp2fl/fl 4-month-old adrenals.
